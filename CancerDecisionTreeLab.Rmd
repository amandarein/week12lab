Congrats! You just graduated from medical school and got a PhD in Data Science at the same time, wow impressive. Because of these incredible accomplishments the world now believes you will be able to cure cancer...no pressure. To start you figured you better create some way to detect cancer when present. Luckily because you are now a MD and DS PhD or MDSDPhD, you have access to data sets and know your way around a ML classifier. So, on the way to fulfilling your destiny to rig the world of cancer you start by building several classifiers that can be used to aid in determining if patients have cancer and the type of tumor. 

The included dataset (clinical_data_breast_cancer_modified.csv) has information 
on 105 patients across 17 variables, your goal is to build two classifiers one 
for PR.Status (progesterone receptor), a biomarker that routinely leads to a 
cancer diagnosis, indicating if there was a positive or negative outcome and 
one for the Tumor a multi-class variable . You would like to be able to explain 
the model to the mere mortals around you but need a fairly robust and flexible 
approach so you've chosen to use decision trees to get started. In building both
models us CART and C5.0 and compare the differences. 

In doing so, similar to great data scientists of the past, you remembered 
the excellent education provided to you at UVA in a 
undergrad data science course and have outlined steps that will need to be 
undertaken to complete this task (you can add more or combine if needed).  
As always, you will need to make sure to #comment your work heavily and 
render the results in a clear report (knitted) as the non MDSDPhDs of the 
world will someday need to understand the wonder and spectacle that will 
be your R code. Good luck and the world thanks you. 

 Footnotes: 
-	Some of the steps will not need to be repeated for the second model, use your judgment
-	You can add or combine steps if needed
-	Also, remember to try several methods during evaluation and always be mindful of how the model will be used in practice.
- Do not include ER.Status in your first tree it's basically the same as PR.Status
